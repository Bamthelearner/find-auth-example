## Authenticating with Flow

This example is a demo for authenticating with your FIND name.

The server (mocked by `/api`) will receive and verify your name, and you will get a JWT, which can be used for future authenticated requests!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
